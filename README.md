## Repository Structure

- **code/**  
  This folder contains the R scripts used to replicate the figures and tables presented in the study. The scripts utilize the processed omics data to analyze biological age rejuvenation.

- **data/**  
  This folder includes the processed omics data, specifically focused on epigenetic changes observed at baseline and after treatment interventions.

- **output/**  
  This folder contains the figures and tables generated from the study, based on the multi-omics analysis performed on the processed data.
